# Discovery Summary

## Key user problems
- Discovery notes are messy and inconsistent
- Ownership is unclear; decisions get lost
- Success metrics aren’t defined early

## Target users
- Primary: Product Manager
- Secondary: Engineers, Designers, Stakeholders

## Goals
- Standardize discovery → PRD output
- Reduce missing requirements and rework
- Improve handoff clarity

## Risks
- Form becomes too heavy and people avoid it
- Teams create parallel templates

## Assumptions
- PM owns intake completion
- Output must be Jira-friendly downstream

## Open questions
- Where will the intake live (Docs, Notion, internal tool)?
- Who approves the PRD (single owner vs committee)?
