# PRD: Intake Form Missing

## Problem
Discovery inputs are fragmented (Slack, docs, meetings). PRDs are inconsistent and often miss owners, assumptions, and success metrics, causing delivery churn.

## Users
- Primary: Product Managers
- Secondary: Engineering, Design, Stakeholders

## Goals
- Create a standardized intake artifact that produces consistent PRDs
- Reduce missing requirements and rework
- Improve handoff clarity and decision traceability

## Non-goals
- Building full project management tooling
- Replacing Jira/Linear

## Requirements
### Must-have
- Single structured intake format
- Captures: problem, users, goals, risks, assumptions, open questions
- Output saved to history in predictable location

### Nice-to-have
- Auto-generate Jira stories from PRD
- Slack updates when PRD is created

## UX Notes
- Minimal fields, progressive disclosure
- Template-driven output

## Metrics / Success Criteria
- % PRDs with explicit assumptions increases to 90%+
- Reduction in “clarification” cycles after handoff (baseline → target TBD)

## Risks / Open Questions
- Will teams adopt vs continue ad-hoc notes?
- What is the governance/approval flow?

## Rollout Plan
- Pilot with 1 team for 2 weeks
- Iterate on template and fields
