# PRD Readiness Validation

**PRD:** `prd/prd.md`
**Validated:** 2026-01-11
**Skill:** `validate_prd_readiness`

## Result: PASS

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Problem section | Pass | Clear problem statement with pain points |
| Users section | Pass | Primary and secondary users defined |
| Goals section | Pass | 3 specific goals listed |
| Metrics present | Pass | Baseline to Target format used, TBD values acceptable |
| Risks captured | Pass | 2 risks identified |
| Assumptions captured | Pass | 3 explicit assumptions |
| Open questions listed | Pass | 5 questions with owners and status |

## Suggested Fixes (Minor)

1. **Open questions missing due dates** — Writing standards recommend "owner + due date when possible". Consider adding target resolution dates.

2. **Many open questions still unresolved** — 5 open questions with "Open" status. Resolving before story breakdown would reduce ambiguity.

## Verdict

PRD is ready to break into stories.
