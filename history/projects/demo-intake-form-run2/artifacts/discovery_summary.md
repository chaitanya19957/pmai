# Discovery Summary: Intake Form Missing

## Key User Problems
1. **Inconsistent requirements capture** - No standard way to document requirements
2. **Scattered information** - Notes live across Slack, docs, and meetings with no single source of truth
3. **Missing context** - Requirements lack necessary background information
4. **Unclear ownership** - No clear assignment of who owns what
5. **Vague success metrics** - Hard to measure if requirements are met

## Target Users
- **Primary (inferred):** Product managers, project leads, and team members who gather or submit requirements
- **Secondary (inferred):** Engineering teams who consume requirements

## Goals & Desired Outcomes
- Single intake form that produces structured output
- Consistent format across all requirement submissions
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Measurable success criteria captured upfront

## Risks
- Adoption risk: Users may resist changing existing habits (Slack, ad-hoc docs)
- Completeness risk: Form may miss edge cases or domain-specific fields

## Assumptions
- Users currently have no formal intake process
- A web-based form is the preferred solution (not specified)
- Structured output means a standardized markdown or document format

## Open Questions
| Question | Suggested Owner |
|----------|-----------------|
| Who are the primary users filling out the form? | Product Lead |
| What systems should the form integrate with (Slack, Jira, etc.)? | Engineering Lead |
| What fields are mandatory vs optional? | Product Lead |
| What is the expected volume of submissions? | Product Lead |
| Should submissions trigger notifications or workflows? | Engineering Lead |
