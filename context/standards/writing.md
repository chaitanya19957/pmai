# Writing Standards

- Use simple English.
- Be concise; prefer bullets over long paragraphs.
- Avoid jargon unless the audience is clearly technical.
- Make assumptions explicit in an "Assumptions" section.
- Track unknowns as "Open Questions" with an owner + due date when possible.
- Prefer measurable metrics (baseline → target) over vague goals.
- Use consistent headings from templates; do not invent new sections unless needed.
