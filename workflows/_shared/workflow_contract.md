# Workflow Contract (Standard)

Every workflow doc must include:

## Purpose
What outcome this workflow produces.

## Inputs
Explicit list of required inputs. Prefer `project_id`.

## Steps (Orchestration)
List skills in order. Do not include tool calls or template paths.

## Outputs (History)
List exact history paths produced.

## Rules
High-level guardrails (simple English, assumptions, etc.)
